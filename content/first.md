## New year, new blog, new technology

This is my first post rendered using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). I chose it
over [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) because:

- Hugo has a built-in webserver ([hugo server](http://gohugo.io/overview/usage)
serves content on localhost:1313).

- Hugo has an autorefresh (called [live reload](http://gohugo.io/extras/livereload))
feature that not only detects local changes, but reloads the browser content
automatically.

- Hugo is supposedly the fastest renderer around, though apparently using
server-side [syntax highlighting](http://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/) may
slow down things a bit.

- According to https://www.staticgen.com and https://staticsitegenerators.net,
Hugo is among the top ten static site generators. Having a strong community is
important.

- I really like some of the tool choices used for the Hugo infrastructure,
such as using [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) for discussion.
Everything just feels very modern, for instance check out the
[views about communication](http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/how-about-an-irc-channel/416).

- One blog I read mentioned lack of pagination being a showstopper, but it's
supposed to be finished for the next release. I feel confident by the time
I'll need it the [enhancement](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/96) will be finished.

- The ease of [installation](https://github.com/spf13/hugo#installing-hugo-binary)
can't be beat. I definitely prefer distro packaging in general, but a single
binary that is built for all the major platforms is pretty easy to use.

I realize that this list isn't all that comprehensive, but perhaps it's of
some usefulness! I've wanted to go the static generation route for a while
now. Mostly so that I can generate content offline using markdown. I think the
page speed and nice theming is an added bonus.

I found this [markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
to be helpful.
